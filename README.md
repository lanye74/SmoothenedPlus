# SmoothenedPlus

This is a compilation of themes designed to benefit [Smoothened](https://github.com/LayneTheEpic/Smoothened).

Please note that they have all been re-written so they are easier to adapt to Smoothened.


Any theme not in this list was an idea of my own. Whether or not it's been done, it probably has. Too bad.


Current theme/snippet list:

- **ModernIndicators** by `@hellbound#9999`
- **A small loading emoji snippet** by `emma ðŸŒº#0968`
- **Harmony Discord (blurple indicators)** by `KraXen72#9190`
