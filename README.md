# SmoothenedPlus

This is a compilation of themes designed to benefit [Smoothened](https://github.com/LayneTheEpic/Smoothened).

Please note that they have all been re-written so they are easier to adapt to Smoothened.


## Any theme not in this list was an idea of my own. Whether or not it's been done, it probably has. *Too bad.*


Current theme/snippet list:
